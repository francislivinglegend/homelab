# Francisco's Homelab

This is a simple project where I aim to learn more about homelabs by experimenting with various tools and configurations.

## üìå Description

This project serves as a personal learning environment focused on building and managing homelab services. It includes a basic Flask service and Nginx Proxy Manager for reverse proxy and access control. The goal is to explore how different components interact within a self-hosted environment.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### üì¶ Dependencies

* Flask
* Docker

### üõ† Installation

Follow the steps below to set up the services.

#### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start the Flask Service

Navigate to the `web_application_flask` directory and run the Python script to start the Flask web service.

```
cd web_application_flask
docker-compose up -d
```

#### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start the nextcloud Service

```
cd nextcloud
docker-compose up -d
```

#### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start the portainer Service

```
cd portainer
docker-compose up -d
```

#### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start Nginx Proxy Manager

Go to the `Nginx_Proxy_Manager_NPM` directory and use Docker Compose to start the containers. This tool helps you easily manage Nginx reverse proxy configurations.

```
cd Nginx_Proxy_Manager_NPM
docker-compose up -d
```

After launching, add the appropriate configurations as shown below (don't forget to enable ssl):
